BEGIN_PGML 

Let [`t`] denote time measured in years, with [`t=0`] corresponding to
the year [$year].  Let [`P`] be the world population at the beginning of
that year.  If the world population [`p(t)`] were to obey
the formula 
[```p(t) = Pe^{[$r] t}```] 
then the annual growth rate would be [_]{$anngr}{6} percent, and it would take 
[_]{$doubleT}{6} years for the population to double.

Enter your answers with a total of at least four digits.
END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION 
After one year the population is multiplied by the factor
[```e^{[$r]}\approx [$exp_r]```]
Subtract 1 and multiply with 100 to see that this corresponds to a growth rate of [$anngr] percent. 

To find the doubling time we need to solve the equation
[```e^{[$r]t} = 2```] 
for [`t`].  
Take the natural logarithm then divide by [$r] to obtain the doubling time:
[``t = \frac{\ln 2}{[$r]} \approx [$doubleT]``] years.
