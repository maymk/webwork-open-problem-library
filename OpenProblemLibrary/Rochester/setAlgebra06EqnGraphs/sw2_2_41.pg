BEGIN_PGML
For the graph of the equation [``\ y=x^4+x^2``],
answer the following questions:

    a) Is the graph symmetric with respect to the [`x`]-axis? [_]{$xsymm}

    b) Is the graph symmetric with respect to the [`y`]-axis? [_]{$ysymm}

    c) Is the graph symmetric with respect to the origin? [_]{$osymm}
END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
a) No, the graph is not symmetric about the [`x`]-axis.  The point [`(1,2)`] is on the graph but its reflection in the [`x`]-axis, [`(1,-2)`], is not.

b) Yes, the graph is symmetric about the [`y`]-axis.  Replacing [`x`] with [`-x`] in the equation produces an equation [``y=(-x)^4+(-x)^2=x^4+x^2``] which is the same as the original equation.  Thus [`(x,y)`] satisfies the (original) equation if and only if its reflection in the [`y`]-axis [`(-x,y)`] satisfies it. 

c) No, the graph is not symmetric about the origin.  The point [`(1,2)`] is on the graph but its reflection in the origin [`(-1,-2)`], is not.
