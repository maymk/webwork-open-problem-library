BEGIN_PGML
For the graph of the equation     
    [``x=[$f]``]    
answer the following questions.  If a question has more than one answer enter them all, separated by commas.  If it has no answers, enter *None*.

a) The [`x`]-intercepts are [`x`] = [_]{$xint}{10}

b) The [`y`]-intercepts are [`y`] = [_]{$yint}{10}

c) Is the graph symmetric with respect to the [`x`]-axis? [_]{$xsymm}

d) Is the graph symmetric with respect to the [`y`]-axis? [_]{$ysymm}

e) Is the graph symmetric with respect to the origin? [_]{$osymm}
END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
a) [`x`]-intercepts: The [`y`] coordinate of every point on the [`x`]-axis is zero.  Thus the graph crosses the [`x`]-axis at a point where [`y=0`], so plug [`y=0`] into the equation [`x=[$f]`] to find the [`x`] intercept, [`x=-[$value] `].  

b) [`y`]-intercepts: The [`x`] coordinate of every point on the [`y`]-axis is zero.  Thus the graph crosses the [`y`]-axis at points where [`x=0`], so plug [`x=0`] into the equation [`x=[$f]`] and solve for [`y`] to find the [`y`]-intercept, [`y= \pm [$y]`].  

c) Yes, the graph is symmetric about the [`x`]-axis because a point [`(x,y)`] satisfies the equation [`x=[$f]`] if and only if [`(x,-y)`] satisfies the equation.  In other words, replacing [`y`] with [`-y`] doesn't change the equation because [`y^2=(-y)^2`].

d) No, the graph is not symmetric about the [`y`]-axis because if [`(x,y)`] satisfies the equation then [`(-x,y)`] does not (unless [`x`] happens to be zero).  In other words, if [`x=[$f]`] then [`-x \neq [$f] `] (unless [`x=0`]). 

e) No, the graph is not symmetric about the origin, because if [`(x,y)`] satisfies the equation then [`(-x,-y)`] does not (unless [`x`] happens to be zero).
