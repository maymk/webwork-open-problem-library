BEGIN_PGML
For the graph of the equation     
    [``y= [$f]``]    
answer the following questions.  If there is more than one answer enter them all, separated by commas.  If there are none enter *None*.

    a) The [`x`]-intercepts are [`x`] =  [_]{$xint}{10}

    b) The [`y`]-intercepts are [`y`] = [_]{$yint}{10}

    c) Is the graph symmetric with respect to the [`x`]-axis? [_]{$xsymm}

    d) Is the graph symmetric with respect to the [`y`]-axis? [_]{$ysymm}

    e) Is the graph symmetric with respect to the origin?  [_]{$osymm}
END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
a) [`y=0`] on the [`x`] axis so plug [`y=0`] into the equation and solve for [`x`] to find the [`x`] intercepts.  Result: there is one [`x`] intercept: [`x=[$xint]`].

b) [`x=0`] on the [`y`] axis so plug [`x=0`] into the equation and solve for [`y`] to find the [`y`] intercepts.  Result: there is one [`y`] intercept: [`y=[$xint]`].

c) No, the graph is not symmetric about the [`x`] axis.  The square root symbol [`\sqrt{}`] stands for the _non-negative_ square root, so [`y\geq 0`] everywhere on the graph.  Thus the graph lies above the [`x`]-axis so it can't be symmetric about the [`x`]-axis. 

d) No, the graph is not symmetric about the [`y`]-axis.  If [``y = [$f]``] then 
[``y \neq \sqrt{-x+[$a]}``]. 

e) No, the graph is not symmetric about the origin.  If [``y = [$f]``] then [``-y \neq \sqrt{-x+[$a]}``].
