BEGIN_PGML
For the graph of the equation [`\ y=x^3+[$a] x`],
answer the following questions:

    a) Is the graph symmetric with respect to the [`x`]-axis? [_]{$xsymm}

    b) Is the graph symmetric with respect to the [`y`]-axis? [_]{$ysymm}

    c) Is the graph symmetric with respect to the origin? [_]{$osymm}
END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
a) No, the graph is not symmetric about the [`x`]-axis. For example, the point (1,[$y]) is on the graph but its reflection in the [`x`]-axis, (1,-[$y]), is not.

b) No, the graph is not symmetric about the [`y`]-axis.  For example, the point (1,[$y]) is on the graph but its reflection in the [`y`]-axis, (-1,[$y]), is not.

c) Yes, the graph is symmetric about the origin.  For if [`(x,y)`] is on the graph then [`\ y=x^3+[$a]x\ `] so [`\ -y=(-x)^3+[$a](-x)\ `] so [`(-x,-y)`] is also on on the graph.
