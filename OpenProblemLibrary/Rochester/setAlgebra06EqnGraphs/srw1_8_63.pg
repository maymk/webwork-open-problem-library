BEGIN_PGML
For the graph of the equation     

    [``x = y^2 - [@ $y**2 @]``]    

answer the following questions.  If a question has more than one answer list them all, separated by commas.  If it has no answer enter *None*.

    a) The [`x`]-intercept(s) are [`x`] = [_]{$xint}

    b) The [`y`]-intercept(s) are [`y`] = [_]{$yint}

    c) Is the graph symmetric with respect to the [`x`]-axis? [_]{$xsymm}

    d) Is the graph symmetric with respect to the [`y`]-axis? [_]{$ysymm}

    e) Is the graph symmetric with respect to the origin? [_]{$osymm}
END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
a) [`y=0`] everywhere on the [`x`]-axis so plug [`y=0`] into the equation and solve for [`x`] to find the [`x`] intercepts.  There is one, [`x=[$xint]`].

b) [`x=0`] everywhere on the [`y`]-axis so plug [`x=0`] into the equation and solve for [`y`] to find the [`y`] intercepts.  There are two, [`y=\pm [$y]`].

c) Yes, the graph is symmetric about the [`x`] axis because whenever [`(x,y)`] satisfies the equation then [`(x,-y)`] also satisfies the equation.

d) No, the graph is not symmetric about the [`y`]-axis because, for example, the point [`([$xint],0)`] is on the graph but [`([@ $y**2 @],0)`] is not.

e) No, the graph is not symmetric about the origin because, for example, the point [``(25-[@ $y**2 @],5)=([@ 25-$y**2 @],5)``] is on the graph but [``\big(-(25 - [@ $y**2 @]),-5\big)=\big(-[@ 25-$y**2 @],-5\big)``] is not.
