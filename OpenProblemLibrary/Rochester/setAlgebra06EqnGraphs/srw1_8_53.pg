BEGIN_PGML
Sketch the graph of the equation 

    [``y=x^2-[$b]``]

on a piece of paper. Then answer the following questions:

    a) The [`x`]-intercepts are: [`\ x_1`] = [_]{-$a}, [`x_2`] = [_]{$a} with [`x_1 < x_2`].

    b) The [`y`]-intercept is: [`\ y`] = [_]{-$b}

    c) Is the graph symmetric with respect to the [`x`]-axis? [_]{$xsymm}

    d) Is the graph symmetric with respect to the [`y`]-axis? [_]{$ysymm}

    e) Is the graph symmetric with respect to the origin? [_]{$osymm}
END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
The graph is a parabola, opening upwards, with vertex at (0,-[$b]). 

a) The parabola intersects the [`x`] axis at [`x = \pm [$a]`].

b) The parabola intersects the [`y`]-axis at [`y=-[$b]`]. 

c) The parabola is not symmetric about the [`x`]-axis because it opens only in one direction: upward.

d) The parabola is symmetric about the [`y`] axis because replacing [`x`] with [`-x`] in the equation doesn't change the equation.  In other words, [`y=x^2-[$b]`] if and only if [`y=(-x)^2-[$b]`].  

e) The parabola is not symmetric about the origin because it opens only in one direction: upward.
