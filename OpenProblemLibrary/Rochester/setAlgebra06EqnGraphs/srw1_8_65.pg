BEGIN_PGML
For the graph of the equation 

    [``x^2y^2+xy=[$a] ``]    

answer the following questions:

    a) Is the graph symmetric with respect to the [`x`]-axis? [_]{$xsymm}

    b) Is the graph symmetric with respect to the [`y`]-axis? [_]{$ysymm}

    c) Is the graph symmetric with respect to the origin? [_]{$osymm}
END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
\a) No, the graph is not symmetric about the [`x`]-axis.  "Symmetry about the [`x`] axis" means that whenever a point [`P=(x,y)`] is on the graph then the reflection [`(x,-y)`] of [`P`] in in the [`x`]-axis is also on the graph.   In other words, if you replace [`y`] with [`-y`] in the equation then the solutions don't change.  But in our case replacing [`y`] with [`-y`] in the equation changes the equation to    
    [``x^2(-y)^2+x(-y) = x^2y^2-xy = [$a]``]     
which is a different equation with different solutions.  

Here's a concrete example.  Let [`x=1`] in the original equation. Then one can solve for [`y`] with the quadratic formula and obtain    
    [``y = (-1 \pm \sqrt{[$d]})/2``]   
so the points    
    [``(1,y_1), (1,y_2)=\Big(1,(-1 \pm \sqrt{[$d]})/2\Big)``]
are on the graph.  But their reflections in the [`x`] axis    
    [``(1,-y_1), (1,-y_2)=\Big(1,(+1 \mp \sqrt{[$d]})/2\Big)``]    
don't satisfy the original equation so they aren't on its graph.    

\b) No, the graph also is not symmetric about the [`y`] axis.   If it were, then whenever [`(x,y)`] is on the graph its reflection in the [`y`]-axis, [`(-x,y)`], would also be on the graph.  One can check this by replacing [`x`] with [`-x`] in the original equation to obtain    
    [``(-x)^2y^2+(-x)y = x^2y^2-xy = [$a]``]     
which, again, is not the same as the original equation.  And one can check that the solutions to these equations really are different using a concrete example, with an argument similar to the one in the previous paragraph. 

\c) Yes! the graph _is_ symmetric about the origin!  To check this replace [`x`] with [`-x`] _and_ replace [`y`] with [`-y`] in the original equation    
    [``(-x)^2(-y)^2+(-x)(-y) = x^2y^2+xy = [$a]``].   
The equation is not changed.   This means that whenever [`(x,y)`] is a solution then [`(-x,-y)`] is also a solution, so both [`(x,y)`] and its reflection in the origin, [`(-x,-y)`], are on the graph.
