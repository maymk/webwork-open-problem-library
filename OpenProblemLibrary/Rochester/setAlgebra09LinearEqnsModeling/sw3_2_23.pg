$a = random(15,40,5);
$b = Real(random(60,100,5));
$ar = $a*$b;

BEGIN_PGML
A rectangular garden is [$a] ft wide. If its area is [$ar] [`\text{ft}^2`],
what is the length of the garden?

    length = [_]{$b}{5} ft.
END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
If the garden is [`L`] feet long then its area is [`(L)([$a])=[$ar]`] sq. ft. so [`L = [$ar]/[$a] = [$b]`] ft.
END_PGML_SOLUTION
