Context("Numeric");

$a = random(10,30,5);
$b = random(600,900,5);
$aac = 1-$a*0.01;
$paac = 1+$aac;

$coworker = Real(round(100*$b/$paac)*0.01)->with(tolType=>"absolute",tolerance=>0.005);
$your = Real($b-$coworker)->with(tolType=>"absolute", tolerance=>0.005) ;

BEGIN_PGML
Your weekly paycheck is [$a] percent less than your coworker's. Your two paychecks total $[$b]. Find the amount of each paycheck.  (Round your answers off to the nearest cent).

Your coworker's weekly check is :  $[_]{$coworker}{10} and yours is $[_]{$your}{10}.
END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Let [`x`] dollars represent your coworkers check. Your check is [$a]% less, so your check is 

    [``\begin{aligned}
     & x - [$a]\% \text{ of } x \\
     &= x - [@ $a*0.01 @]x \\
     &= (1-[@ $a*0.01 @])x \\
     &= [$aac]x
     \end{aligned} ``]
     
Together, the two checks total [`x+[$aac]x = [$b]`] dollars, so 

    [``\begin{gathered}
    x+[$aac]x = [$b] \\
    (1+[$aac])x = [$b]\\
    [$paac]x = [$b]\\
    x = \frac{[$b]}{[$paac]} = [$coworker] \end{gathered}``]

dollars is your coworker's weekly check, and yours is [`[$b]-[$coworker]=[$your]`] dollars.
