BEGIN_PGML
In a certain class grades are determined by students' scores on four tests, each worth 100 points. A student has scores of [$c1], [$c2], and [$c3] points on the first three tests.  The student needs an average of at least [$a]% to earn a grade of [$g].  What is the minimum score that the student needs on the fourth test to ensure a [$g]?  (The answer need not be an integer.)

   The student needs at least [_]{$ans}{10} points on the fourth test to earn a [$g].
END_PGML 

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
If the student earns [`x`] points on the fourth test the student's average score will be 

    [``\text{average score} = \frac{[$c1]+[$c2]+[$c3]+x}{100+100+100+100}``]
    
so to earn the grade [$g] the student needs

    [``\begin{gathered}
    [$a]\%=\frac{[$a]}{100}\leq \frac{[$c1]+[$c2]+[$c3]+x}{100+100+100+100}\\
    (4)([$a])\leq [$c1]+[$c2]+[$c3]+x \\
    (4)([$a])-[$c1]-[$c2]-[$c3] \leq x \\
    [$ans] \leq x \end{gathered} ``]
