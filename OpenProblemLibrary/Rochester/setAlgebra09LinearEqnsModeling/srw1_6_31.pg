BEGIN_PGML
The radiator in a car is filled with a solution of [$antifr]% 
antifreeze and [$water]% water.  The manufacturer of the
antifreeze suggests that for summer driving, optimal cooling of the
engine is obtained with only 50% antifreeze.  If the capacity
of the radiator is [$cap] liters, how much coolant (in liters) must be
drained and replaced with pure water to reduce the antifreeze
concentration to 50%?

    [_]{$ans}{10} liters of coolant must be drained and replaced with water
END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Before draining and refilling with water, [$antifr]% of the [$cap] liters of the coolant in the radiator is antifreeze, so before draining the radiator contains   

    ([@ $antifr*0.01 @])([$cap]) = [@ $antifr*0.01*$cap @] liters of antifreeze (before draining).
    
If [`x`] liters of this coolant are drained out then the volume of antifreeze in the radiator will be reduced by [`[@ $antifr*0.01 @]x`] liters  so 

    ([@ $antifr*0.01*$cap @] - [`[@ $antifr*0.01 @]x`]) liters of antifreeze remains in the radiator after draining.
    
The volume of antifreeze in the radiator doesn't change when it is refilled with pure water. When it is refilled the volume of antifreeze will be (50% of [$cap]) = [@ $cap/2 @] liters so  

    [``\begin{gathered}
    [@ $antifr*0.01*$cap @] - [@ $antifr*0.01 @]x = [@ $cap/2 @]\\
    [@ $antifr*0.01*$cap @]- [@ $cap/2 @] = [@ $antifr*0.01 @]x \\
    \frac{[@ $antifr*0.01*$cap-$cap/2 @]}{[@ $antifr*0.01 @]} = [$ans] = x
    \end{gathered} ``]
    
Thus [$ans] liters of the original coolant must be drained and replaced with pure water to reduce the concentration of antifreeze to 50%.
