$a = Real(random(9,10,1));
$b = random(12,13,1);
$c = random(15,16,1);

$d = (3*$a+$b+$c)/4;

BEGIN_PGML
The oldest child in a family of four children is twice as old as the youngest. 
The two middle children are [$b] and [$c] years old. 
If the average age of the children is [$d], how old is the youngest child?

    youngest child is [_]{$a}{5} years old
END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
If the youngest child is [`x`] years old then the oldest is [`2x`] years old    so their average age is [`[$d] = (x+[$b]+[$c]+2x)/4`] years.  Thus

    [``\begin{gathered}
    (4)([$d]) = 3x+[@ $b+$c @]\\
    \frac{[@ 4*$d -$b -$c @]}{3}=[$a]= x 
    \end{gathered} ``]
