BEGIN_PGML
Wilma drove at an average speed of [$v1] mi/h from her home in City A to 
 visit her sister in City B. She stayed [$s] hours in City B, and on the trip
back averaged [$v2] mi/h. She returned home [$t] hours after leaving.
How many miles is City A from City B?

    City A is [_]{$ans}{10} miles from City B
END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Let 

    [`t_1`] = time she took to drive from City A to City B    
    [`t_2`] = time she took to drive back from City B to City A
    
The total time she spent on her trip was [`[$t] = t_1+[$s]+[t_2]`] so 

    [`t_2 = [$tms] - t_1`]
    
Assuming she took the same route on both trips between City A and City B, the distance she traveled on each of those trips was 

    distance from City A to City B = ([$v1] mi/h)([`t_1`] hr) = ([$v2] mi/h)([`t_2`] hr)
    
Substituting in the previous result, [`t_2 = [$tms] - t_1`], one can solve for [`t_1`] 

    [``\begin{gathered}
    [$v1]t_1 = [$v2]([$tms]-t_1)  \\
    [$v1]t_1 = ([$v2])([$tms])-[$v2]t_1  \\
    [@ $v1+$v2 @]t_1 = [@ $v2*$tms @] \\
    t_1 = [@ $v2*$tms @]/[@ $v1+$v2 @]
    \end{gathered}``]
    
So the distance from City A to City B is 

    ([$v1] mi/h)([@ $v2*$tms @]/[@ $v1+$v2 @] hr) = [$ans] miles
