$a = random(25,35,1);

BEGIN_PGML
A rectangular room is [$b] times as long as it is wide, and its perimeter is [$a] meters. Find the dimension of the room.
{
The length is [_]{$len}{10} meters and the width is [_]{$wid}{10} meters.
END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Let [`w`] represent the room's width. Its length is [`[$b]w`]. Its perimeter is 

    [``\begin{aligned}
    [$a]&=2(\text{length})+2(\text{width})\\
    &=2([$b]w)+2w \\
    &=[$m]w \end{aligned} ``]
    
meters so the width is

    [``w=\frac{[$a]}{[$m]} = [$wid]``]
    
meters and the length is 

    [``([$b])(w) = ([$b])([$wid]) = [$len]``]
    
meters.
