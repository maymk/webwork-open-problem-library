BEGIN_PGML
Express the average age of three sisters in the terms of the age
[`a`] (in years) of the firstborn if the second sister was born [$a]
years after the first and the third was born [$b] years after the second.

     average age is [_]{$ans}{10}
END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
The second sister is [$a] years younger than the first and the third is [$b] years younger than the second so 

    [`a`] = first sister's age    

    [`a-[$a]`] = second sister's age    

    [`a-[$a]-[$b]`] = third sister's age    

Thus

    [``\text{average age} = \frac{a + (a-[$a]) + (a-[$a]-[$b])}{3} ``]
