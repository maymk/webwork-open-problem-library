BEGIN_PGML
Mutt and Jeff need to paint a fence.  If each man worked alone, Mutt would do the job in [$A] fewer hours than Jeff.  Working together for [$B] hours they finish [$num]/[$den] of the job. 

How long would Jeff need to paint the fence working alone?

Your answer must be a number.  No arithmetic operations are allowed.

It would take Jeff [_]{$sol1}{10} hours to do the job alone.
END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Assign variables to represent the number of hours each man would take to finish the job if working alone:  

    [`M`] hours for Mutt     
    [`J`] hours for Jeff.
    
So the _rate_ that each man works is 

    Mutt does [``\frac{1}{M}``] jobs per hour    
    
    Jeff does [``\frac{1}{J}``] jobs per hour.
    
If they were working together, without changing their rates of work, they would accomplish 

    [``\frac{1}{M}+\frac{1}{J}``] jobs per hour working together.
    
Together, they finish [$num]/[$den] of the job in [$B] hours, so 

    [``\frac{[$num]}{[$den]}(\text{jobs}) = \Big(\frac{1}{M}+\frac{1}{J}\Big)(\text{jobs per hour})\times [$B](\text{hours}) ``]
    
that is,

    [``\frac{[$num]}{[$den]}= \Big(\frac{1}{M}+\frac{1}{J}\Big)([$B]) ``]
    
We also know that, working alone, Mutt could do the job in [$A] fewer hours than Jeff so 

    [`M=J-[$A]`]
    
Plug that into the previous equation to obtain an equation that one can solve for [`J`]:

    [``\begin{gathered}\frac{[$num]}{[$den]}= \Big(\frac{1}{J-[$A]}+\frac{1}{J}\Big)([$B])\end{gathered} ``]
    
Multiply both sides by [`[$den](J-[$A])J`] to cancel the denominators, and solve for [`J`]

    [``\begin{gathered}
    [$den](J-[$A])J\Big(\frac{[$num]}{[$den]}\Big)= [$den](J-[$A])J\Big(\frac{1}{J-[$A]}+\frac{1}{J}\Big)([$B])\\
    [$num](J-[$A])J = [$den]\big(J+(J-[$A])\big)([$B]) \\
    [$num](J^2-[$A]J) = [@ $den*$B @](2J-[$A]) \\
    [$num]J^2 - [@ $A*$num @]J = [@ 2*$den*$B @]J - [@ $A*$den*$B @]\\
    [$num]J^2 - [$P]J + [$Q] = 0
    \end{gathered} ``]
    
Use the quadratic formula to solve this equation for [`J`]

    [``\begin{aligned}
    &J=\frac{[$P] \pm \sqrt{[$P]^2 -4([$num])([$Q])}}{2([$num])}\\
    &J \approx [$sol1] \text{ or } J\approx [$sol2] \end{aligned}``]
    
But [`M=J-[$A]`], and this can't be negative, so one must discard the second solution and conclude that 

    it would take Jeff approximately [$sol1] hours to do the job working alone.
