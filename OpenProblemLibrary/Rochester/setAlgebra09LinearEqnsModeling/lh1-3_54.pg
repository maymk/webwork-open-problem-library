BEGIN_PGML

Suppose that you are taking a course that has four tests. The first three tests are for 100 points each and the fourth test is for 200 points. To get an B in the course, you must have an average of at least 80 percent on the 4 tests. Your scores on the first 3 tests were [$a], [$b], and [$c]. What is the minimum score you need on the fourth test to get an B for the course?.

    You need [_]{$ans}{10} points on the fourth test.
END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Your average score on the four tests is

    [``\text{av. score} = \frac{\text{your total score}}{\text{total points available}}``]
    
So to have an average score of at least 80% = 0.80, you need

    [``0.80 \leq \frac{\text{your total score}}{\text{total points available}}``] 
    
500 = 100+100+100+200 points are available on the four tests so you need

    [``\begin{gathered}
    0.80  \leq \frac{\text{your total score}}{500}\\
    (0.80)(500)\leq  \text{your total score} \\
    400\leq  \text{your total score} \end{gathered} ``]
    
You have already earned [$a]+[$b]+[$c]=[$sum] points, so you need to earn at least 400-[$sum] = [$ans] points on the fourth test to receive a B.
