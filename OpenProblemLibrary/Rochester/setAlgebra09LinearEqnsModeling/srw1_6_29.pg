BEGIN_PGML
What quantity of [$pct1]% acid solution must be
mixed with the right amount of [$pct2]% acid solution to produce [$total] mL of a 50% acid solution?

    [_]{$sol1}{10} ml of [$pct1]% solution
END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

Let

    A be the [$pct1]% acid solution    
    B be the [$pct2]% acid solution    
    C be the 50% solution.
    
A is combined with B to produce C.  To understand this one must keep two facts in mind:

    1.  the volume of A plus the volume of B equals the volume of C.
    2.  the volume of acid in A plus the volume of acid in B equals the volume of acid in C.
    
First let's look at the volumes of the solutions.  Let    

    [`x`] mL = the volume of solution A    
    [`y`] mL = the volume of solution B    
    [$total] mL = the volume of solution C    
    
Then    
    [``\begin{gathered}
    x+y = [$total]\\
    y = [$total]-x
    \end{gathered} ``]
    
Now look at the volume of acid in each solution.

    [$pct1]% of A is acid so the volume of acid in A is [`[$dec1]x`] mL    
    [$pct2]% of B is acid so the volume of acid in B is [`[$dec2]y`] mL       
    50% of C is acid so the volume of acid in C is (0.50)([$total])=[@ .50*$total @] mL
    
Thus 
    [`[$dec1]x + [$dec2]y = [@ .50*$total @]`].    

Now substitute our previous result [` y = [$total]-x`] into the above equation to obtain an equation that one can solve for [`x`]:

    [``\begin{gathered}
    [$dec1]x + [$dec2]([$total]-x) = [@ .50*$total @] \\
    [$dec1]x + ([$dec2])([$total])-[$dec2]x = [@ 0.5*$total @] \\
    ([$dec1]-[$dec2])x + [@ $dec2*$total @] = [@ 0.5*$total @] \\
    [@ $dec1-$dec2 @]x = [@ 0.5*$total @] - [@ $dec2*$total @] = [@ 0.5*$total-$dec2*$total @]\\
    x = \frac{[@ 0.5* $total-$dec2*$total @]}{[@ $dec1-$dec2 @]} = [$sol1] \end{gathered} ``]
    
So one may combine [$sol1] mL of [$pct1]% acid solution with [$total]-[$sol1]=[$sol2] mL of [$pct2]% acid solution to obtain [$total] mL of 50% acid solution.
