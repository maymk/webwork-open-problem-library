Taxylvania has a tax code that rewards charitable giving.  A person who gives
[`p`]% of his or her income to charity pays [`([$TAX] - [$RATE] p)`]% 
tax on the remaining money.  For example, if he gives 10%
of his income to charity, he pays [$example1]% tax on the remaining money. If she gives [$example2]% of her income to charity, she pays no tax on
the remaining money.  Taxpayers do not receive a tax refund for giving more 
than [$example2]% of their incomes to charity.  

Count Taxula earned $[$INCOME] last year.  What percentage of his income should he give to charity to maximize the amount of money he has after paying taxes and charitable giving?

    To maximize his money he should give [_]{$noref}{10}% to charity.

If the rules were changed to allow the count to receive a tax refund for giving more than [$example2]% of his income to charity, how much should he give to charity to maximize his money?

    If refunds were allowed then to maximize his money he should give [_]{$okref}{10}% to charity.

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Suppose Count Taxula gives [`p`]% of his income to charity.  His income is 

    income = [$INCOME]

dollars, so the amount he gives to charity is 

    charity = [`p`]% of [$INCOME] = [`(p/100)([$INCOME])`]  
    
dollars.  He must pay tax on the remaining money which is  

    taxable income = [`[$INCOME]-(p/100)([$INCOME]) = (1-p/100)([$INCOME]`]) 
    
dollars.  The amount of tax he will pay,

    tax = (tax rate)(taxable income) = (tax rate)(1-p/100)([$INCOME])

dollars, depends on his tax rate.  There are two cases:

*Case 1:* Tax refunds are not allowed, so the tax rate can't be negative.  

*Case 2:* Tax refunds are allowed, so the tax rate can be negative.  

Case 2 is the simplest case because there are no restrictions on the tax rate so we'll consider case 2 first.   In case 2 the tax rate is

        tax rate = [`([$TAX] - [$RATE] p)\% = ([$TAX] - [$RATE] p)/100 `]

    so his tax is
    
        [``\begin{aligned}
           \text{tax} &= \Big(\frac{[$TAX] - [$RATE] p}{100}\Big)(\text{taxable income})\\
           &= \Big(\frac{[$TAX] - [$RATE] p}{100}\Big)\Big(1-\frac{p}{100}\Big)([$INCOME])\\
           &= \Big(\frac{[$TAX] - [$RATE] p}{100}\Big)\Big(\frac{100-p}{100}\Big)([$INCOME])\\
           &= \Big(\frac{[@ $TAX*100 @] - [@ $RATE*100 + $TAX @]p + [$RATE]p^2}{10000}\Big)([$INCOME]) 
          \end{aligned} ``] 

dollars.  Thus the amount of money he has remaining after paying charity and taxes is 

    [``\begin{aligned} 
    f(p) &=(\text{income})-(\text{charity})-(\text{taxes})\\
    &=[$INCOME]-(p/100)([$INCOME])-\Big(\frac{[@ $TAX*100 @] - [@ $RATE*100 + $TAX @]p + [$RATE]p^2}{10000}\Big)([$INCOME]) \\
    &= \Big(1 - p/100 - \frac{[@ $TAX*100 @] - [@ $RATE*100+$TAX @]p + [$RATE]p^2}{10000}\Big)[$INCOME] \\
    &= \Big(\frac{10000 - 100p - [@ $TAX*100 @] + [@ $RATE*100+$TAX @]p -[$RATE]p^2}{10000}\Big)[$INCOME] \\
    &= ([@ 10000-$TAX*100 @] + [@ $RATE*100+$TAX-100 @]p -[$RATE]p^2)([@ $INCOME/10000 @])
    \end{aligned} ``]

dollars.  Count Taxula wants to maximize this amount [`f(p)`].  The coefficient of [`p^2`] in this formula is negative so its graph is a downward-pointing parabola with a maximum at the [`p`] coordinate of the vertex, 

    [``p_{vertex} = \frac{-[@ $RATE*100+$TAX-100 @]}{2(-[$RATE])}=[@ ($RATE*100+$TAX-100)/(2*$RATE) @] ``]

Thus, in case 2, Count Taxula should give [`p_{vertex}`]% of his income to charity to maximize the amount of money he retains after donating to charity and paying taxes.

Now consider case 1.  All the calculations are the same as in Case 2, except the tax rate cannot be negative, so 

    [``\begin{aligned}
    \text{tax rate} &= ([$TAX] - [$RATE] p)\% = ([$TAX] - [$RATE] p)/100 \geq 0 \\
    [$TAX]&\geq [$RATE] p \\
    \frac{[$TAX]}{[$RATE]} &= [$example2] \geq p \end{aligned}``].

In this case the count receives no tax advantage for donating more than [$example2]% of his income to charity, so he will limit himself to donating no more than [$example2]% of his income to charity because he wants to maximize the money that remains after charity and taxes. 

The same function [`f(p)`] that we derived in case 2 represents the money that remains after charity and taxes if he donates [`p`]%  of his income to charity, but now we must limit [`p`] to the range [`-\infty < p \leq [$example2]`].   

If [`p_{vertex}\leq [$example2]`] then  [`f(p)`] is maximized if [`p=p_{vertex}`] for the same reason as before.

Otherwise suppose that [`[$example2]<p_{vertex}`].  The graph of [`f(p)`] is a downward pointing parabola so the value of [`f(p)`] increases with [`p`] whenever [`p<p_{vertex}`].  Thus, if [`[$example2]<p_{vertex}`], then [`f(p)`] is maximized on the interval [`-\infty < p < [$example2]`] when [`p=[$example2]`].
