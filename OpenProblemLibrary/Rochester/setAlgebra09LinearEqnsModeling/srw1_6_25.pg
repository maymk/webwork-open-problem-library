BEGIN_PGML
Two cyclists, [$distance] miles apart, start riding toward each other at the same time. One cycles [$mult] times as fast as the other.  If they meet [$hours] hou    rs later, what is the speed (in mi/h) of the faster cyclist?

    Faster cyclist's speed is [_]{$fast}{10} mi/hr
END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
In mi/hr, let

    [`s`]  be the speed of the slower cyclist.  Then    
    [`[$mult]s`] is the speed of the faster cyclist.  
    
As they ride toward each other the distance between them decreases at a rate of [`s+[$mult]s = [$multp1]s`] mi/hr. That distance decreases from [$distance] to 0 in [$hours] hr., so 

    [`[$distance] = ([$multp1]s)([$hours])`]
    
Thus 

    [``s=\frac{[$distance]}{([$multp1])([$hours])}``]
    
and

    [``[$mult]s=\frac{([$mult])([$distance])}{([$multp1])([$hours])} = [$fast]``] mi/hr
