BEGIN_PGML

Solve for [`x`]:    
    [``\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} [$A] x^{n-1} = [$B] ``]    

[`x = `][_]{$x}{15}

END_PGML

#$ans1 = 1-$A/$B;

#ANS(num_cmp($ans1));

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
We are given that 
    [`x^0+x^1+x^2+\cdots = [$B]/[$A].`]    
For [`x^0`] to make sense we must assume [`x\neq 0`], and for the series to converge we must assume    
    [`-1<x<1.`]    
Assuming these conditions hold, multiply the first equation by [`x`] to obtain    
    [`x^1+x^2+x^3+\cdots = x([$B]/[$A]).`]    
Subtract this from the first equation to obtain    
    [`x^0 = (1-x)([$B]/[$A])`]    
so    
    [`\frac{1}{1-x} = [$B]/[$A]`]    
because [`x^0=1`].  Solving for [`x`], obtain    
    [`x = 1-[$A]/[$B]=[$x]`]    
which is not zero, and is between [`\pm 1`], so it is the solution.
