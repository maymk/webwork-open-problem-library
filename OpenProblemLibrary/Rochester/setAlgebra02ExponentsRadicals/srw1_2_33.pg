$ans = Real($a**$b+$a**$c);

BEGIN_PGML
Evaluate the expression [``\ [$a]^[$b]+[$a]^[$c] ``].

Your answer must be an exact number, not an algebraic expression. 

    [``[$a]^[$b]+[$a]^[$c]``] = [_]{$ans}{10}
END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Raising numbers to powers ("exponentiation") is not very closely related to addition there is no really nice formula for simplifying this problem.  The easiest and simplest approach is to just work it directly:  
[``[$a]^[$b]+[$a]^[$c] = [@ $a**$b @]+[@ $a**$c @] = [$ans]``].

However people who prefer something that looks more sophisticated can use the distributive law to get the same result:  
[``[$a]^[$b]+[$a]^[$c] = [$a]^[$b](1+[$a]^{[@ $c-$b @]}) = [@ $a**$b @](1+[@ $a**($c-$b) @]) = ([@ $a**$b @])([@ 1+ $a**($c-$b) @]) = [$ans] ``].

The distributive law works here because both terms in the sum [``[$a]^[$b]+[$a]^[$c]``] are the same base number [$a] raised to various powers.  If the base numbers weren't the same, for example if the sum were [``[$a]^[$b]+13^[$c],``] then the distributive law wouldn't fit into the problem.
