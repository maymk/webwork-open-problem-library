BEGIN_PGML
Randomly selected [$n1] student cars have ages with a mean of [$x1] years and a 
standard deviation of [$s1] years, while randomly selected [$n2] faculty cars have
ages with a mean of [$x2] years and a standard deviation of [$s2] years. 

1. Use a t-test with significance level [$alpha] to test the claim that student cars are 
older than faculty cars. 

    a) The test statistic is [_]{$stat}{10}

    b) The critical value is [_]{$crit}{10}

    c) Is there sufficient evidence to support the claim that student cars are older than faculty cars?  [_]{$YN}

2. Construct a [$perc]% confidence interval estimate of the difference
[`\mu_1 - \mu_2`], where [`\mu_1`] is the mean age of student cars and [`\mu_2`]
is the mean age of faculty cars.

     [_]{$min}{10} [`< (\mu_1 - \mu_2) <`] [_]{$max}{10}

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Our goal is to use data from the sample of student and faculty cars:

    [$dat]*

to infer something about the overall population means [`\mu_1`] and [`\mu_2`].

\1.  In this part we'll use a one-sided t-test because we're asked to test the claim that the students' cars are older than the faculty cars, that is, [`\mu_1-\mu_2>0`]. 
 
a) The test statistic is    

    [`` t= \frac{\bar{x}_1-\bar{x}_2}{\sqrt{s_1^2/n_1+s_2^2/n_2}} \approx [$stat] ``]. 

\b) The parameter [`p`] for the t-distribution is the significance level [`p = [$alpha]`] because this is a one-sided test.  The degrees of freedom for the t distribution are [`df = n_1+n_2-2 = [$df]`].  Plug [`p = [$alpha]`] and [`df = [$df]`] into a t-statistic calculator or table to find the

    critical value = [$crit] for the t-statistic.

\c) The evidence supports the claim if [`t`] > critical value, so the answer to part c) is [$choice].   

\2. The confidence interval for the difference [`\mu_1-\mu_2`] is an interval centered at [`\bar{x}_1-\bar{x}_2`].  The width of the interval is calculated using the t-distribution. Because [`\mu_1-\mu_2`] could be above or below the center we'll treat the t-distribution as we would for two-sided t-test.  

We're looking for a [$perc]% confidence interval so (100-[$perc])% = [@ $alpha/2 @] of the area in the t-distribution lies outside the region that represents the interval. Thus we'll use the t-distribution with parameter    

    [`p = [$halfalpha]`] and [$df] degrees of freedom.    

From a t-distribution calculator or table one obtains the critical value    

    [`t = [$t]`]

The endpoints of the interval are    

    [`\bar{x}_1-\bar{x}_2\pm e`]

where    

    [``e = t\sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1}+\frac{s_2^2}{n_2}} = [$e]``]    

so the [$perc]% confidence interval is 

    [`[$min] < \mu_1-\mu_2 < [$max]`]
