BEGIN_PGML
A square rug lies in the middle of a rectangular room.  There are [$A] feet of
uncovered floor on two opposite sides of the rug.  On the other two opposite sides of the rug there are [$B] feet of uncovered floor.  Each side of the rug is [`x`] feet long.  Find a polynomial expression for the area of the room.

The area of the room is  
    [_]{$ans}{15} square feet.
END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
"There are [$A] feet of
uncovered floor on two opposite sides of the rug" so, measuring in one direction, from one side of the room to the opposite side of the room, there are [$A] feet of uncovered floor, then [`x`] feet of rug, then another [$A] feet of uncovered floor, so the distance across the room in this direction is  
    [`([$A]+x+[$A]) = (x+[@ 2*$A @])`] feet.  

Measuring across the room in the other direction there are [$B] feet of uncovered floor, then [`x`] feet of rug, then another [$B] feet of uncovered floor, so the distance across the room in this other direction is  
    [`([$B]+x+[$B]) = (x+[@ 2*$B @])`] feet.  
    
The area of the rectangular room is the product of these two distances  
    area = [`[$ans]`] square feet
