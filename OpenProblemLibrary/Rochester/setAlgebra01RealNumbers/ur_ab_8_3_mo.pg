BEGIN_PGML
The set
    S = [``(-\infty,[$a]] \cup [[$b],\infty) ``]    
is the union of two intervals in the real number line.  [`S`] can also be described as the set of all [`x`] that satisfy a _single_ inequality of the form     
    [`|x-a|\geq b`]    
where [`a`] and [`b`] are certain numbers.  What are these numbers? 

    [`a`] = [_]{$center}{5}, and [`b`] = [_]{$radius}{5}
END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
The inequality
    [`|x-a|\geq b `]    
means
    [`x-a \leq -b\ `] or [`\ b \leq x-a`].    
Add [`\ a\ `] to both sides of these inequalities to obtain the equivalent statement    
    [`x \leq a-b\ `] or [`\ b+a \leq x`].    
This statement is equivalent to saying that [`x`] is in the union
    [``(-\infty,a-b] \cup [a+b,\infty) ``].    
To make this union agree with the set [`S`] in the problem, all we need to do is set    
    [`a-b = [$a]\ `] and [`\ a+b = [$b]`].    
Solving these equations for [`a`] and [`b`] we obtain
    [`a = [$center]\ `]  and  [`\ b = [$radius]`].
