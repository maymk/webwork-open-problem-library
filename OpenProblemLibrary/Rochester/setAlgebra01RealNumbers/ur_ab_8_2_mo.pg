#  Setup

Context("Interval");

$a = random(2,5,1);
$b = random(-5,5,1);
$c = random(3,10,1);
$ab = $a*$b;
$ac = $a*$c;

$ans = Interval( -$b-$c,-$b+$c);

BEGIN_PGML
The set of [`x`] that satisfy the inequality  [` |[$a] x + [$ab] | < [$ac] `] is an interval on the real number line.  Write this interval in interval notation.  [@ helpLink("intervals") @]*

    The interval is [_]{$ans}{15}
END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
The inequality [`|[$a] x+[$ab]|<[$ac]`] means
    [`-[$ac] < [$a] x+[$ab] < [$ac] `].    
Subtract [$ab]    
    [``\begin{gather} -[$ac]-[$ab] < [$a] x < [$ac]-[$ab] \\
    [@ -$ac-$ab @] < [$a] x < [@ $ac-$ab @] \end{gather}``]    
then divide through by [$a] to obtain
    [`[@ -$c-$b @] <  x < [@ $c-$b @] `].    
Thus [`x`] is in the interval [`[$ans]`].
