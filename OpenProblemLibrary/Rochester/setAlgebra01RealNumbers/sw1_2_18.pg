## First we set up our variables.
$a = random(5,25,1);
$a1 = $a+1;
$a2 = $a+2;
$a3 = $a+3;
$b = random(5,25,1);
$b1 = $b+1;
$b2 = $b+2;
$b3 = $b+3;

$ans1 = DropDownTF("T");
$ans2 = DropDownTF("F");

BEGIN_PGML
Enter a T or an F in each answer space below
to indicate whether the corresponding statement is true or
false. 

To receive credit both of the answers must be correct.

    [_]{$ans1}{5} [``\ \frac{[$a]}{[$a1]} < \frac{[$a2]}{[$a3]}``]    

    [_]{$ans2}{5} [``\ -\frac{[$b]}{[$b1]} < -\frac{[$b1]}{[$b2]}``]

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

It's easy to compare fractions if they have a common denominator.  

([$a1])([$a3]) is a common denominator for the first pair of fractions.    
    [``\ \frac{[$a]}{[$a1]} = \frac{([$a])([$a3])}{([$a1])([$a3])} = \frac{[@ $a*$a3 @]}{([$a1])([$a3])}``].    
    [``\frac{[$a2]}{[$a3]}=\frac{([$a1])([$a2]}{([$a1])([$a3])} = \frac{[@ $a1*$a2 @]}{([$a1])([$a3])} ``].    
Comparing the numerators,   
    [` [@ $a*$a3 @] < [@ $a1*$a2 @] `]    
so the first statement is *true*, [``\ \frac{[$a]}{[$a1]} < \frac{[$a2]}{[$a3]}``].

([$b1])([$b3]) is a common denominator for the second pair of fractions.    
    [``\ -\frac{[$b]}{[$b1]} = \frac{(-[$b])([$b3])}{([$b1])([$b3])} = \frac{-[@ $b*$b3 @]}{([$b1])([$b3])}``].    
    [``-\frac{[$b2]}{[$b3]}=\frac{(-[$b1])([$b2]}{([$b1])([$b3])} = \frac{-[@ $b1*$b2 @]}{([$b1])([$b3])} ``].    
Comparing the numerators,   
    [` -[@ $b*$b3 @] > -[@ $b1*$b2 @] `]    
so the second statement is *false*, in fact [``\ -\frac{[$b]}{[$b1]} > -\frac{[$b2]}{[$b3]}``].

(This comparison was easy because the common denominator was positive.  How would you have to modify it if the common denominator were negative?)

Of course, one may also compare fractions by converting them into decimal numbers either by hand or on a calculator.
