$a = Real(random(2,4,1));
$b = Real(random(2,4,1));
$c = Real(random(2,4,2));
$d = Real(random(3,7,2));
$coef = 5*$c;

BEGIN_PGML;
Factor the polynomial [`[$poly]`]. The answer can be written as    
    [`[$poly]=(5x-B)(Cx+D)`]     
with [` B`], [`C`], and [`D `] integers, where 

    [`B=`][_]{$b}{10}, and       
    [`C=`][_]{$c}{10}, and     
    [`D=`][_]{$d}{10}
  
END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
    [`(5x-B)(Cx+D)=(5C)x^2+(5D-BC)x-BD`]    
so [`[$poly]=(5x-B)(Cx+D)`] if and only if    
    [`5C=[$coef]`] and [`BD=[$n]`] and [`5D-BC=-[$t]`].    
Thus [`C=[$c]`], and there are only a few possibilities for integers [`B`] and [`D`] because [`BD=[$n]`].  One possibility is [`B=[$b]`] and [`D=[$d]`], and if this is true then also [`5D-BC = 5([$d])-([$b])([$c])=-[$t]`] so all three equations are satisfied.  Thus    
    [`B=[$b]`] and [`C=[$c]`] and [`D=[$d]`].
