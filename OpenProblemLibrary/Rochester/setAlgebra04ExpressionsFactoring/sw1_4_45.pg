$a = Real(random(6,9,1));
$b = Real(random(1,4,1));
$t = $a-$b;
$n = $a*$b;

BEGIN_PGML 
Factor the polynomial [`x^2-[$t] x-[$n]`]. Your answer can be written as
    [`x^2-[$t] x-[$n] = (x+A)(x+B)`]     
where [`A \lt B`] and

    [`A`] equals: [_]{-$a}{10} and

    [`B`] equals: [_]{$b}{10} 
END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
    [``(x+A)(x+B)=x^2+(A+B)x+AB``]    
is equal to [`x^2-[$t] x-[$n]`] if and only if    
    [`AB = -[$n]`] and [`A+B=-[$t]`].    
The problem is easiest if [`A`] and [`B`] are integers, because there aren't very many pairs of integers [`A,B`] that satisfy the first equation [`AB = -[$n]`].  Checking all these pairs, one finds that      
    if [`A=-[$a]`] and [`B=[$b]`]    
then    
    [`AB=-[$n]`] and [`A+B=-[$t]`] and [`A<B`]   
which is exactly what is required for a solution.
