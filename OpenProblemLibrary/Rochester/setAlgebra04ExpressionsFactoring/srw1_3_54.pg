Context("Numeric");

$b = Real(random(2,4,1));
$c = Real(random(2,4,2));
$d = Real(random(3,7,2));

$coef = 5*$c;
$t = 5*$d+$b*$c;
$n = $b*$d;

BEGIN_PGML;
Factor the polynomial [`[$coef] x^2+[$t] x+[$n]`]. The answer can be written as    

    [`[$coef] x^2+[$t] x+[$n]=(5x+B)(Cx+D)`]    

with integers [` B`], [`C`], and [`D `], where  

    [`B`] equals: [_]{Real([$b])}{10}, and       
    [`C`] equals: [_]{Real([$c])}{10}, and       
    [`D`] equals: [_]{Real([$d])}{10}
END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
    [`(5x+B)(Cx+D)=(5C)x^2+(5D+BC)x+BD`]    
so [`[$coef] x^2+[$t] x+[$n]=(5x+B)(Cx+D)`] if and only if    
    [`5C=[$coef]`] and [`BD=[$n]`] and [`5D+BC = [$t]`].    
Thus    
    [`C=[$coef]/5=[$c]`],    
and there are only a few possibilities for integers [`B`] and [`D`] so that [`BD=[$n]`]. Working through these possibilities, one finds that [`B=[$b]`] and [`D=[$d]`] satisfy both equations [`BD=[$n]`] and [`5D+BC = 5D+B([$c])=[$t]`].  So the answer is   
     [`B=[$b]`] and [`C=[$c]`] and [`D=[$d]`].
