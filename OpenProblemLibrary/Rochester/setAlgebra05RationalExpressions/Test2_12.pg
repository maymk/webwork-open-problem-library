BEGIN_PGML
An _ohm_ is a unit that is used for measuring electrical _resistance_ in an electrical circuit or network. (Roughly speaking, _resistance_ measures how difficult it is to push electrons through the circuit.) The symbol [`\Omega`] represents ohms. 

Three resistors, with resistance S, T, and W ohms are connected in a small network.  

    [@ image('resistor_net.png', extra_html_tags => 'Diagram of a resistor network.  Not required for solving this problem.') @]*

The total resistance, [`R`], from point A to point B of this network is given by the formula:

    [``R = S + \left(\frac{1}{\frac{1}{T}+\frac{1}{W}}\right) ``]
  
One can rewrite this formula as a single fraction [`\frac{A}{B}`] where the numerator
[`A`] and denominator [`B`] contain no fractions.  What are [`A`] and [`B`]?
  
    [`A =`] [_]{$ans1}{15}
  
    [`B =`] [_]{$ans2}{15}
  
Suppose that [` S = [$s] \Omega`], [`T = [$t] \Omega`] and [`W = [$u] \Omega `].  Find [`R`], and enter your result as a decimal number.
  
    [`R =`] [_]{$ans3}{10} [`\Omega`]
