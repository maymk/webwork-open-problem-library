Context("Numeric");

$x1 = random(1,5,1);
$y1 = random(-5,-1,1);
$x2 = random(-10,-3,1);
$y2 = random(-9,-2,1);
$len1 = Real(sqrt(($x1-$x2)**2 + ($y1-$y2)**2));
$midx = ($x1+$x2)/2;
$midy = ($y1+$y2)/2;

$midpt = Point($midx,$midy);

BEGIN_PGML;
Consider the two points [` ([$x1] ,[$y1] )`] and [` ([$x2] ,[$y2] )`].
The distance between them is:[_]{$len1}{10}
  
The of the midpoint of the line
segment that joins them is:[_]{$midpt}{10} [@ helpLink('points') @]*
  
END_PGML

$dsq = ($x1 - $x2)**2 + ($y1 - $y2)**2;

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Recall that for two points [`P(x_1, y_1)`] and [`Q(x_2,y_2)`], the distance between [`P`] and [`Q`] is

     [` |PQ|=\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2} `]

and the coordinates of the midpoint of the segment that joins [`P`] and [`Q`] are

     [` x_m = \frac{x_1+x_2}{2}, \ \ \ \ \ y_m = \frac{y_1+y_2}{2} `]

Therefore the distance between [` ([$x1] ,[$y1] )`] and [` ([$x2] ,[$y2] )`] is

    distance = [`\sqrt{([$x2] - [$x1])^2+([$y2] - [$y1])^2} = \sqrt{[$dsq]} = [$len1] `]

and the midpoint is

    midpoint = [` \left(\frac{[$x1]+[$x2]}{2}, \frac{[$y1]+[$y2]}{2}\right)= ([$midx],[$midy])`]

Note: if you did not know the formulas for the distance or the coordinates of the midpoint, you could just draw a
coordinate system, plot the given points, measure the distance and find the midpoint of the segment joining them. You would
see from the picture what are the coordinates of the midpoint.
