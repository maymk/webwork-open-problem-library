$h = non_zero_random(-6,6,1);
$k = non_zero_random(-6,6,1);

$ans1 = $h;
$ans2 = $k;
$ans3 = $h**2;

BEGIN_PGML
Find an equation of the circle that is tangent to the [`y`]-axis and has center at
[`([$h],[$k])`].  Your equation should have the form

    [``(x-A)^2+(y-B)^2=C``] 
    
where [`A, B, C`] are constant. 
   
    [`A`] is : [_]{Real([$ans1])}{10}
  
    [`B`] is : [_]{Real([$ans2])}{10}
  
    [`C`] is : [_]{Real([$ans3])}{10}
END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
The point where the circle is tangent to the [`y`] axis is the point [`(0,[$k])`] on the [`y`] axis that is closest to the center.  The distance from this point to the center is [@ abs($h) @] so the radius is [`r=[@ abs($h) @]`].  If [`(x,y)`] is an arbitrary point on the circle then [`r`] is the distance from [`(x,y)`] to the center.  In symbols

    [``\sqrt{(x-[$h])^2+(y-[$k])^2} = [@ abs($h) @] ``]
    
Square both sides to obtain

    [``(x-[$h])^2+(y-[$k])^2 = [$ans3]``]
    
so [`A = [$h]`], [`B=[$k]`], [`C=[$ans3]`].
