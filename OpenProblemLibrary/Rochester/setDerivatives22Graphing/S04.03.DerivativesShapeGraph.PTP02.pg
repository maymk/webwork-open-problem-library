Please answer the following questions about the function
$PAR
\[ f(x) = \frac{$a x^2}{x^2 + $bs}.  \]
$BR
${BBOLD}Instructions:${EBOLD}  If you are asked to find a function,
enter a function.  If you are asked to find \(x\)- or \(y\)-values, enter either a number, a list of numbers separated by commas, or ${BITALIC}None${EITALIC} if there aren't any solutions.  Use \{ helpLink('interval', 'interval notation') \} if you are asked to find an interval or union of intervals, and enter \(${LBRACE}${RBRACE}\) if the interval is empty.
$PAR


(a) Calculate the first derivative of \( f \).  Find the critical
numbers of \(f\), where it is increasing and decreasing, and its local
extrema.
$BR
\( f'(x) = \) \{ans_rule(40)\}
$BR
Critical numbers \( x = \) \{ans_rule(40)\} 
$BR
Increasing on the interval \{ans_rule(40)\} 
$BR
Decreasing on the interval \{ans_rule(40)\}
$BR
Local maxima \(x = \) \{ans_rule(40)\}
$BR
Local minima \(x = \) \{ans_rule(40)\}
$PAR


(b) Calculate the second derivative of \( f \).  Find where \(f\) is
concave up, concave down, and has inflection points.
$BR
\( f''(x) = \) \{ans_rule(40)\}
$BR
Concave up on the interval \{ans_rule(40)\} 
$BR
Concave down on the interval \{ans_rule(40)\}
$BR
Inflection points \(x = \) \{ans_rule(40)\}
$PAR


(c) Find any horizontal and vertical asymptotes of \(f\).
$BR
Horizontal asymptotes \(y = \) \{ans_rule(40)\}
$BR
Vertical asymptotes \(x = \) \{ans_rule(40)\}
$PAR

(d) The function \( f \) is \{pop_up_list(['?','even','odd','neither']) \} because \{pop_up_list(['?','f(-x) = f(x)','f(-x) = - f(x)','not applicable']) \} for all \( x \) in the domain of \( f \), and therefore its graph is symmetric about the 
\{pop_up_list(['?','x-axis','y-axis','origin','line y=x','not applicable']) \}
$PAR

(e) Sketch a graph of the function \( f \) without having a graphing calculator do it for you.  Plot the \(y\)-intercept and the \(x\)-intercepts, if they are known.  Draw dashed lines for horizontal and vertical asymptotes.  Plot the points where \( f \) has local maxima, local minima, and inflection points.  Use what you know from parts (a) and (b) to sketch the remaining parts of the graph of \( f \).  Use any symmetry from part (d) to your advantage.  Sketching graphs is an important skill that takes practice, and you may be asked to do it on quizzes or exams.
