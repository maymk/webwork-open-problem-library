BEGIN_PGML
A random sample of 10 observations was drawn from a large normally 
distributed population.  The data are below.    

[@ $tab @]*

Test to determine if, at the [$siglev]% significance level, we can infer that the 
population mean is not equal to [$mu], filling in the requested 
information below.   

\A. The value of the standardized test statistic is: [_]{$t}{10}

_Note:_ For the part B, your answer should use interval notation.  [@ helpLink("interval") @]* 

\B. The rejection region for the standardized test statistic is:  [_]{$rej_reg}{15}  

\C. The p-value is [_]{$p}{10}

\D. Your decision for the hypothesis test.  ([`H_0`] is the null hypothesis, [`H_1`] is the alternative).

    [_]{$radio}

END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
The null hypothesis [`H_0`] says 

    population mean = [`\mu`] = [`[$mu]`]  (Null hypothesis)

Our random sample of [`n=[$n]`] values [`x`] has 

    sample mean = [`\bar{x}=\sum x/n`] = [`[$mean]`]  

    sample standard deviation = [``s=\sqrt{\frac{\sum (x-\bar{x})^2}{n-1}}``] = [`[$sd]`]    

    test statistic = [``t=\frac{\bar{x}-\mu}{s/\sqrt{n}}``]=[`[$t]`]

Use a two-sided t-test because the sample is small, and we are testing whether [`\mu`] is different (larger or smaller, hence "two-sided") from the nominal value [$mu].  T-test calculators are available on the internet for computing [`p`] (search for "two-sided t-test calculator").  

On the two-sided t-distribution with [`n-1=[$df]`] degrees of freedom, the p-value for the test statistic is 

    [`p=[$p]`].  

Compare [`p`] with the required significance level 
[`\alpha=[$alpha]`].  If [`p<\alpha`] then the data support rejecting the null hypothesis. Otherwise the data don't support rejecting the null hypothesis.  

A related way to decide whether or not to reject the null hypothesis is by finding the ``rejection region``.  This is the set of hypothetical values of the test statistic that should cause one to reject the null hypothesis.  It the set of numbers whose *absolute value is larger* than the so-called "critical value", [`t_{\text{crit}}`].  T-test calculators on the internet can produce the critical value.  

In our case, the two-sided t-test calculator says that 

    [`t_{\text{crit}}= [$tcrit]`].

so
 
    rejection region = [``[$rej_reg]``]. 

If the test statistic is in the rejection region then the data support rejecting the null hypothesis. Otherwise the data don't support rejecting the null hypothesis.
