BEGIN_PGML

Cans of regular Coke are labeled as containing [`12 \text{ oz}`].    
Statistics students weighed the contents of [$n] randomly chosen cans, and found the mean
weight to be [$mean] ounces.     

Assume that cans of Coke are filled so that the actual amounts are normally distributed with a mean of 12.00 oz and a standard deviation of [$dev] oz. Find the probability that a sample of [$n] cans will have a mean amount of at least [$mean]  oz.

END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
The z-score is [`z = \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}} = \frac{[$mean]-12.00}{[$dev]/\sqrt{[$n]}} = [$z]`].  Using a computer or a table one finds that the probability [`z > [$z]`] is [$p] (approximately).
