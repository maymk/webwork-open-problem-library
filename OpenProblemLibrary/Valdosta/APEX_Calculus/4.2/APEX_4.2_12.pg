$PAR
A rope, attached to a weight, passes vertcally up through a pulley
in the ceiling and then straight back down to a worker who holds the rope
in his hand.  The worker walks away at a constant rate $rate ft/s, keeping his hand at the same distance $h0 feet below the ceiling.  How fast is the weight rising
when the worker has walked:

$BR$BBOLD Solution:$EBOLD 
$PAR
When the worker has walked \(x\) feet his hand, the pulley, and the point 
$h0 feet directly beneath the pulley form a right
triangle with height $h0, base length \(x\),
and hypotenuse \(z\).  Let \(y\) be the distance
from the weight to the pulley.   The rate the weight rises 
equals the rate \(-dy/dt\) at which \(y\)  
decreases.  Also 
\[ y+z = \text{length of rope} \]
is constant (assuming the rope doesn't stretch and the worker doesn't let it slip through his hand) so 
\[\frac{dy}{dt} + \frac{dz}{dt}=\frac{d(\text{constant})}{dt} = 0\]
hence 
\[ -\frac{dy}{dt} = \frac{dz}{dt} \]
is the answer that we seek.  
$PAR
\(z\) and \(x\) are related by
the Pythagorean theorem
\[ z^2 = x^2 + $h0^2.\]
Differentiating, one obtains
\[ 2z\frac{dz}{dt} = 2x\frac{dx}{dt} + 0. \]
The worker is walking away at the rate
\[ \frac{dx}{dt} = $rate \]
ft/s so if \(x\) is known then one can compute 
\(z\) and \(dz/dt\):   
 
$PAR
When \(x = 10\),
\[
  10^2 + $h0^2 = z^2 \;\Rightarrow\; z = \sqrt{$a1}.
\]
\[
  \Rightarrow \dfrac{dz}{dt} = \dfrac{$num1}{\sqrt{$a1}}
  \approx $r1
\]
ft/s.
$PAR
When \(x = 30\),
\[
  30^2 + $h0^2 = z^2 \;\Rightarrow\; z = \sqrt{$a2}.
\]
\[
  \Rightarrow \dfrac{dz}{dt} = \dfrac{$num2}{\sqrt{$a2}}
  \approx $r2
\]
ft/s.
