push @q, "If  \(\  S_1  \)  and \(\  S_2  \) are subspaces of \( R^n\) of the same dimension, then \(S_1=S_2\).";
push @a, DropDownTF("False");
push @s, "False.  In the \(x,y\)-plane the coordinate axes are 1-dimensional subspaces, but they are not the same.";


push @q, "If  \( \  S = \text{span}\{u_1, u_2, u_3 \}\)  then  \(\text{dim}(S) = 3\) .";
push @a, DropDownTF("False");
push @s, "False. The vectors (1,0), (0,1), and (1,1) span the \(x,y\)-plane, but the \(x,y\)-plane is 2-dimensional. These vectors are not linearly independent.";

push @q, "If a set of vectors \(U\) spans a subspace \(S\), then zero or more vectors can be added to \(U\) to create a basis for \(S\) (i.e. there is a set of vectors \(V\) with \(U\subseteq V\) which i-s a basis of \(S\)).";
push @a, DropDownTF("False");
push @s, "False.  If the vectors in \(U\) are not linearly independent then \(U\) cannot be a subset of a basis.";

push @q, "If a set of vectors \(U\) is linearly independent in a subspace \( S\) then zero or more vectors can be added to \(U\) to create a basis for \(S\) (i.e. there is a set of vectors \(V\) with \(U\subseteq V\) which is a basis of \(S\)).";
push @a, DropDownTF("True");
push @s, "True. If \(U\) spans \(S\) then \(U\) is a basis for \(S\). Otherwise \(S\) contains a vector that is not in the span of \(U\). If you include that vector in \(U\) you'll get a larger set that is still linearly independent. Repeating this process you'll get larger and larger sets of linearly independent vectors until the number of vectors in the set equals the dimension of \(S\). When that happens the set of vectors will be a basis for \(S\). (That it's a basis isn't obvious but it's proved in linear algebra texts.  The fact that \(S\) is finite-dimensional is crucial. It is finite dimensonal because \(S\subseteq X\) and \(X\) is finite dimensional.  Infinite dimensonal spaces are much trickier).";   

push @q, "If a set of vectors \(U\) spans a subspace \(S\), then zero or more vectors can be removed from \(U\) to create a basis for \(S\) (i.e. there is a set of vectors \(V\) with \(V\subseteq U\) which is a basis of \(S\)).";
push @a, DropDownTF("True");
push @s, "True. If \(U\) is linearly independent then \(U\) is a basis.  Otherwise one of the vectors in \(U\) is a linear combination of the others, so you can remove this vector from \(U\), and the remaining vectors will still span \(S\).  Continuing in this fashion you can remove vectors one-by-one until you obtain a minimal linearly independent subset of \(U\).  This subset is a basis for \(S\).  (This argument depends on the fact that the dimension of \(S\) is finite.  It is finite because \(S\subseteq X\) and \(X\) is finite dimensonal.  Infinite dimensional spaces are much trickier.)";

push @a, DropDownTF("False");
push @s, "False.  If \(U\) does not span \(S\) then no subset of \(U\) can span \(S\) so no subset of \(U\) is a basis for \(S\).";

push @q, "Three nonzero vectors that lie in a plane in \(\mathbf{R}^3\) might form a basis for \(\mathbf{R}^3\).";
push @a, DropDownTF("False");
push @s, "False. If three vectors lie in a plane they can't be linearly independent, so they can't be a basis for \(\mathbf{R}^3\).";
