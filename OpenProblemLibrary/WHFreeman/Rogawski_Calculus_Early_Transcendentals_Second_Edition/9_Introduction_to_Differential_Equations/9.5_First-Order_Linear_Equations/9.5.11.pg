BEGIN_PGML
In this problem you will solve the initial value problem    
    [` x y' = [$a] y - [$b] x\ `] with [`\ y(1) = [$y1] `].

    (a) Identify an integrating factor, [`\alpha(x)`].    
        [`\alpha(x)`] = [_]{$alpha} 

    (b) Find a general solution of the differential equation [` x y' = [$a] y - [$b] x`].    
    Your "general solution" should be valid at every point in an open rectangle that includes the initial condition [`(x,y)=(1,[$y1])`].     
    Use [`C`] for the arbitrary constant.      
        [`y(x)`] = [_]{$ans1}{15} 

    (c) Solve the initial value problem.    
        [`y(x)`] = [_]{$ans2}{15}
END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
(a) The first step is to divide by [`x`] to rewrite the differential equation in the standard form for linear ODEs    
    [`` y' - \frac{[$a]}{x} y = -[$b] \ .``]    
Dividing by [`x`] assumes that [`x\neq 0`], and the initial conditions say [`y=[$y1]`] when [`x=1`], so the solution must be defined in an open interval around the point [`x=1`]. Thus in the following we'll assume that [`x>0`]. 
 
From the standard form of the ODE it follows that an integrating factor is    
    [`` \begin{aligned} \alpha(x) &= \exp\left(\int -\frac{[$a]}{x} \;dx\right) \\
       & = \exp(-[$a]\ln(x)+K) = e^K x^{-[$a]} \end{aligned}``]    
where [`K`] is some constant.  Any choice of [`K`] will work; [`K=0`] gives the 
simplest formula, so we'll take     
    [``\alpha(x)=x^{-[$a]}``].    
     
(b) When multiplied by the integrating factor [`\alpha(x)=x^{-[$a]}`], the standard form of the linear ODE becomes:
    [`` x^{-[$a]} y' - [$a] x^{-[$ap1]} y = -[$b] x^{-[$a]}``]    
so            
    [`` \Big( x^{-[$a]} y\Big)' = -[$b] x^{-[$a]}``]    
That's the whole point of an integrating factor -- multiplying the standard form of the ODE by the integrating factor turns the left-hand side into a derivative.  Now one can integrate both sides 
    [``x^{-[$a]} y = \int -[$b] x^{-[$a]} \; dx = [$bdivam1] x^{-[$am1]} + C``]    
then multiply by [`x^{[$a]}`] to solve for [`y`] and obtain the general solution 
    [``y = [$ans1]``]    
where [`C`] is an arbitrary constant.

(c) The initial condition says [`y=[$y1]`] when [`x=1`] so, plugging these values into the general solution, one obtains    
    [``\begin{gathered} [$y1] = [$bdivam1] + C \\
     [$y1]-[$bdivam1] = [$C] = C \end{gathered}``]    
Thus the solution to the initial value problem is    
    [`` y = [$ans2] ``]

Remark: it turns out that the solutions in parts (b) and (c) also satisfy the ODE when [`x< 0`], but one should not expect something like that to happen in all problems.
