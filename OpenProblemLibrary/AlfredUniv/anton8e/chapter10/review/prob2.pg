BEGIN_PGML
Consider the infinite series     
    [`` \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^2} ``]    
Which of the following convergence tests is a good way to decide whether or not this series converges?  Check all that apply.    
    [_]{$test}

Does the series converge?    
    [_]{$convergeQ}
END_PGML 

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
* [``0=\lim_{n\to\infty} 1/n^2 \ ``] so the "divergence test" does not apply.
* Our series is not a geometric series.
* Our series is a series of positive terms and [``\int_1^\infty 1/x^2\; dx < \infty ``] so the integral test says that the series converges. 
* Our series is a "p-series" with [`p=2`] which is larger than 1, so the "P-series test" says that the series converges.
* To use the "comparison test" we'd need another series [``\ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} b_n \ ``] that satisfies the criteria for the comparison test, and where it's easier to decide the convergence or divergence of this series than it is for 
our series.  I can't think of any good candidates for the series [``\ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} b_n``], can you?
* The "limit comparison test" has the same issue as the "comparison test".
* [``\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{1/(n+1)^2}{1/n^2} = 1 ``] so the "ratio test" does not yield any useful information.
* Our series is not an alternating series.
