BEGIN_PGML
Solve for _M_ :    
    [` P=C+MC `]

    [`M = `] [_______________]{$ans[0]}
END_PGML
BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
    [``\begin{gathered} P=C+MC \\ P-C=MC \end{gathered}``]    
Assume [`C\neq 0`].  Then one can divide by [`C`] so    
    [`(P-C)/C = M`]    
The computer expects this solution, so it's marked "correct". 

But it's really not correct if [`C=0`].  In that case the equation [`P-C=MC`] becomes [`P=(M)(0)=0`] so [`P`] must be 0 but [`M`] could be any number at all.  So if [`C=0`] the equation tells us what [`P`] is but it says nothing about [`M`] so [`M`] could be any number. 
END_PGML_SOLUTION

else {
BEGIN_PGML
Solve for [`p`]:    
    [`T=D+pm`]

END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
    [``\begin{gathered} T=D+pm \\ T-D = pm \end{gathered} ``]    
Assume [`m\neq 0`].  Then one may divide by [`m`] to obtain    
    [`(T-D)/m = p`]    
The computer expects this solution, so it's marked "correct".

But it's really not correct if [`m=0`].  If [`m=0`] then the equation [`T=D+pm`] becomes [`T=D`] so it says [`T`] and [`D`] are the same, but it says nothing about [`p`] so [`p`] could be any number.
