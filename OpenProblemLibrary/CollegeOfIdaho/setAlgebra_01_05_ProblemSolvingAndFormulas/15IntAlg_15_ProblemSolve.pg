#  Setup

#  Main text

if ($n==0){
$answer = Formula("(C-By)/A");
BEGIN_PGML
Solve for [`x`] :    
    [` Ax + By =C `]

    [`x = `][_______________]{$answer} 
END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Assume [`A \neq 0`].  Then may divide by [`A`] so    
    [``\begin{gathered} Ax+By=C \\ Ax = C-By \\ x = (C-By)/A \end{gathered} ``]    
This is the expected answer so the computer marks it "correct".

But if [`A=0`] the expected answer is nonsense.  For if [`A=0`] the equation says [`By=C`], which says nothing about [`x`], so if [`A=0`] them [`x`] could be any number.
END_PGML_SOLUTION

$answer = Formula("(C-Ax)/B");
BEGIN_PGML
Solve for [`y`] :    
    [` Ax + By =C `]

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Assume [`B \neq 0`].  Then may divide by [`B`] so    
    [``\begin{gathered} Ax+By=C \\ 
    By = C-Ax \\ 
    y = (C-Ax)/B \end{gathered} ``]    
This is the expected answer so the computer marks it "correct".

But if [`B=0`] the expected answer is nonsense.  For if [`B=0`]  the equation says [`Ax=C`], which says nothing about [`y`], so if [`B=0`] then [`y`] could be any number.
