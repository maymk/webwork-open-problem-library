BEGIN_PGML
Video Store A charges $[$a] to rent a video game for one week.
Although only members can rent from the store, membership is free.
Video Store B charges only $[$b] to rent a video game for one 
week.  Only members can rent from the store and membership is 
$[$c] per year.  After how many video game rentals will the 
total amount spent at each store be the same?  Assume all the games are rented within one year.

a) Write an equation to model the problem.  Let _x_ represent the number of video game rentals.

    Answer: [_______________]{equation_cmp($ans_a)}

b) Solve your equation to answer the question. (Note: Your answer should be in the form _Z rentals_, where _Z_ is a number.)  

    Answer: [_______________]{$ans_b}
END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Part a)  Suppose one rents [`x`] games from each store during one year. Then store A will charge [`[$a]x`] dollars to rent the games, and store B will charge [`[$b]x`] to rent the games plus [$c] dollars for a one-year membership.  So one will spend the same amount at each store if 
    [``[$a]x =[$b]x + [$c]``].
    
Part b)  One can solve the equation from part a) to find what [`x`] needs to be so the amount spent at each store is the same.  
    [``\begin{gathered} [$a]x =[$b]x + [$c] \\ 
    ([$a]-[$b])x = [$c] \\ 
    [@ $a-$b @]x = [$c] \\ 
    x=[$c]/[@ $a-$b @] = [@ $c/($a-$b) @] \end{gathered}``]    
Thus [$ans_b] in one year would cost the same at either store.
