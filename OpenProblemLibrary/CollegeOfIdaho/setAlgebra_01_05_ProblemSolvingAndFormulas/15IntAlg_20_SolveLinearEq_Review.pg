BEGIN_PGML
a) Solve the equation for [`[$var] `].  If a single value of [`[$var]`] satisfies the equation, enter that value.  If every real number satisfies the equation, enter _All real numbers_.  If no real number satisfies the equation enter _No solution_ .

    [`[$a] ([$var] + [$b]) = [$c] + [$d] [$var] `]

    [`[$var] = `][___]{$ans_a}{15}

b) Select the word that best describes the equation.

$ad = $a-$d;
$cab = $c-$a*$b;
if ($ans_b eq "conditional"){
BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Part a)
Suppose [`[$var]`] is a real number that satisfies the equation.  Then
    [``\begin{gathered} 
    [$a] ([$var] + [$b]) = [$c] + [$d] [$var]\\
    [$a][$var]-[$d][$var] = [$c] - ([$a])([$b])   \\
    [$ad][$var] = [$cab]  \\
    [$var] = \frac{[$cab]}{[$ad]}=[$ans_a]
    \end{gathered} ``]    
This shows that only one real number [$var] = [$ans_a] can satisfy the equation.  One can easily check that [$var] = [$ans_a] actually does satisfy the equation by, for example, plugging [$var] = [$ans_a] into the equation and verifying that both sides are equal.  

Part b) Because one, but not all, real numbers satisfy the equation, the equation is "conditional".  
END_PGML_SOLUTION
}

if ($ans_b eq "identity"){
BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Part a)
    [``\begin{gathered} 
    [$a] ([$var] + [$b]) = [$c] + [$d] [$var]\\
    [$a][$var]-[$d][$var] = [$c] - ([$a])([$b])   \\
    0 = 0 \end{gathered} ``]    
Thus the equation [`[$a] ([$var] + [$b]) = [$c] + [$d] [$var] `] is equivalent to the equation [`0=0`], which is true for every possible value of [`[$var]`].  All real numbers satisfy the equation.

Part b)  The equation is an identity because it is true for every value of [`[$var]`].
END_PGML_SOLUTION
}

if ($ans_b eq "inconsistent"){
BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Part a)
    [``\begin{gathered} 
    [$a] ([$var] + [$b]) = [$c] + [$d] [$var]\\
    [$a][$var]-[$d][$var] = [$c] - ([$a])([$b])   \\
    0 = [$cab] \end{gathered} ``]    
Thus the equation [`[$a] ([$var] + [$b]) = [$c] + [$d] [$var]`] is equivalent to the equation [`0 = [$cab]`], which is false no matter what value is given to the variable [`[$var]`].  The equation has no solution.

Part b)  The equation is inconsistent because it has no solution.
