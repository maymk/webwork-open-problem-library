BEGIN_PGML
After a [$a]% reduction in price, you purchase a television for $[$b].
What was the television's price before the reduction?

a) Write an equation to model the problem.  Let _x_
represent the price before the reduction.  Your equation must strictly model the wording in the problem.

    Answer: [_______________]{$ans_a}

b) Solve the equation to find the price before the reduction. (Note: Your answer should be in the form _$[$string]_.  (In other words, your answer must include dollars and cents.)  

    Answer: [__________]{$ans_b}
END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Part a)  Let [`x`] dollars be the original price of the TV, before it was reduced.  The price was reduced by  
    ([$a]% of [``x``]) = [``[$p]x``]    
dollars so, after reduction, the price was
    [``x - [$p]x``]    
dollars.  The problem says the reduced price was [$b] dollars, so
    [``x - [$p]x = [$b]``]    
dollars.

Part b)
    [``\begin{gathered} x - [$p]x = [$b] \\ 
    (1-[$p])x = [$b] \\ 
    [@ 1-$p @]x = [$b] \\ 
    x = [$b]/[@ 1-$p @] = [@ $b/(1-$p) @] \end{gathered}``]    
dollars, which is [$ans_b].
