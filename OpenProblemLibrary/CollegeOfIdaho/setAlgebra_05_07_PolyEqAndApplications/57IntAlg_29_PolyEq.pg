BEGIN_PGML
A rectangular lawn has a length that is [$n] yards greater than its width.  The area of the lawn is [$A] square yards.

Note:  The formula for the area of a rectangle is    
    Area = length [`\times`] width.

a) Write a polynomial equation that relates the width to the area of the lawn.  Use the variable [`x`] to represent the width of the lawn.

    Answer:  [_]{$ans_a}{15}

b)  Solve the equation and give the width of the lawn.

    Width = [_]{$ans_b}{10}  
END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Part a)
    [`x`] yards = width of lawn    
    [`x+[$n]`] yards = length of lawn    
    [$A] square yards = area of lawn    
Plugging these values into the formula for the area of a rectangle one obtains
    [`(x+[$n])x = [$A] `]    
square yards.    

Part b)
    [``\begin{gathered} (x+[$n])x = [$A] \\
    x^2+[$n]x -[$A] = 0 \end{gathered} ``]    
Factoring the polynomial, or using the quadratic formula,
one finds that     
    [`x=[$w]`] or [`x= -[@ $w+$n @] `].    
But a width isn't negative so the lawn is [$ans_b] wide.
