BEGIN_PGML
Each side of a square is lengthened by [$n] inches.  The area of the resulting, larger square is [$A] square inches.  Find the length of a side of the original square.

(Note:  The formula for the area of a square is [`\text{Area} = \text{side}^2`].)

a) Write a polynomial equation for the area of the larger square.  Use the variable [`\ s\ `] to represent the length of a side of the original square.

    Answer:  [_]{$eqn}{15}

b)  Solve the equation, and give the length of the side of the original square.

    Length:  [_]{$ans_b}{15} [@ helpLink('units') @]*
END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Part a) The lengthened side is [`s + [$n]`] inches long, so the area of the resulting square is area [`(s+[$n])^2 `] square inches.  Thus 
     [`(s+[$n])^2 = [$A] `]    
square inches.

Part b) Taking square roots, one obtains    
    [` s+[$n] = \pm \sqrt{[$A]} = \pm [@ [$s] + [$n] @] `]    
Subtracting [$n] one obtains [`s = [$s]`] or [`s = [@ -$s-2*$n @] `].  Only the positive value makes sense as a length, so the length of a side of the original square was 
    length = [$ans_b].
