# (x^2-a^2) - (m-n)(x-a)=0

BEGIN_PGML
The product of a number decreased by [$m] and the same number increased by [$n] is [$c].  Find all numbers satisfying this condition.

a) Write a polynomial equation whose solution(s) solve this problem. Let [`x`] represent the number. 

    Answer: [_]{$eqn}{15}

b)  Solve your equation and enter your solution as a list of equations separated by the word _or_.  For example [`x=a`] if exactly one number _a_ is a solution, or [`x=a \text{ or } x=b`] if there are two solutions _a_ and _b_, and so on.  If there are no solutions enter DNE (it stands for "Does Not Exist"). 

     Answer:  [_]{$ans_b}{30}
END_PGML

$const = -$m*$n-$rhs;
$poly2 = Formula("x^2-($m-$n)x - $m*$n")->reduce;
$poly3 = Formula("x^2-($m-$n)x + $const")->reduce;
BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Part a)  Let [`x`] represent the number.  Then    
    [`x-[$m]`] is the number decreased by [$m]    
    [`x+[$n]`] is the number increased by [$n]    
so the problem says
    [`(x-[$m])(x+[$n]) = [$c] `]

Part b)
    [``\begin{gathered} (x-[$m])(x+[$n]) = [$c] \\
    [$poly2] = [$c] \\
    [$poly3] = 0 \end{gathered} ``]   
By factoring, or using the quadratic formula, one obtains
    [$ans_b].
