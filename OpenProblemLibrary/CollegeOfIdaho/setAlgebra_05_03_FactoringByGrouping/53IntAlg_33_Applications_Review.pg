#  Setup

BEGIN_PGML
After a [$a]% reduction, you purchase a new computer for [$salePrice].
What was the computer's price before the reduction?

a) Write an equation to model the problem.  Let [`x`] 
represent the price of the computer before the reduction. Your answer must strictly model the wording of the problem.

    Answer: [_]{$ans_a}{20}

b) Solve the equation to find the answer to the question above.

    Answer: [_]{$ans_b}{20}
END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Part a)
    [`x`] dollars was price before reduction  
    [`[$p]x`] dollars was amount of price reduction    
so    
    [`x - [$p]x = [$b]`]    
is the sales price in dollars, after the reduction.

Part b)
    [``\begin{gathered} x - [$p]x = [$b] \\
    [@ 1- $p @]x = [$b]\\
    x = [$b]/[@ 1- $p @] = [@ $b/( 1- $p) @] \end{gathered} ``]    
[$ans_b] was the price before it was reduced.
