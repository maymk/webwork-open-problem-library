BEGIN_PGML
A rectangular box has a base [$l] inches long and [$w] inches wide, and the height of the box is [$h] inches.  
Find the angle between the diagonal of the box and 
the diagonal of its base.  The angle should be measured in
radians.  

    angle = [_]{$ans}{10}
END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Let [`A`] be one corner of the base, [`B`] be the opposite corner on the base, and [`C`] be the point that is directly above [`B`] on the top of the box. [`ABC`] is a right triangle with right angle at [`B`], and [`AC`] is its hypotenuse.  [`AC`] is also a diagonal of the box, and [`AB`] is a diagonal of the base of the box. Therefore angle [`A`] of this triangle is the angle that we want.

Its cosine is 
    [``\begin{aligned} \cos(A) &= \frac{\text{length of }AB}{\text{length of }AC} \\
    &= \frac{\sqrt{[$l]^2+[$w]^2}}{\sqrt{[$l]^2+[$w]^2+[$h]^2}} \end{aligned} ``]    
so    
    [``A = \arccos\left(\frac{\sqrt{[$l]^2+[$w]^2}}{\sqrt{[$l]^2+[$w]^2+[$h]^2}}\right) \approx [$ans] \text{ radians}``].
