BEGIN_PGML;
A company manufactures and sells [`x`] electric drills per month.
The monthly cost and price-demand equations are

    [` C(x) = [$a] + [$b] x`],

    [` p = [$c] - \frac{x}{30}, \qquad 0 \leq x\leq 5000`].
  
(A) Find the production level that results in the maximum profit.
  
    Production Level = [_]{Real(15*($c-$b))}{10} drills per month
  
(B) Find the price that the company should charge for each drill
in order to maximize profit.
  
    Price = [_]{Real(($b+$c)/2)}{10}
  
END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
The revenue for selling [`x`] drills is  
    Revenue = [``xp=[$c]x-\frac{x^2}{30}``]

The profit is Revenue - Cost = [``-\frac{x^2}{30}+[@ $c-$b @]x-[$a]``].

The marginal profit (derivative of profit with respect to [`x`]) is

    marginal profit = [``-\frac{x}{15}+[@ $c-$b @] ``]
    
Profit is maximized when its derivative is zero:

    [``\begin{aligned} 0 &=-\frac{x}{15}+[@ $c-$b @]\\
       x &= [@ 15*($c-$b)@] \end{aligned}``]
       
Plug [`x=[@ 15*($c-$b)@]`] into the price equation to obtain the price the company
should charge to maximize profits.

    max profits when price = [``[$c]-\frac{[@ 15*($c-$b)@]}{30}=[@ ($b+$c)/2 @]``]
