BEGIN_PGML
Suppose that [` \ 0 < A < AB < 1 < B \ `].

Rank the following five expressions from least to greatest.

END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Here are some observations:

[` A<1 `] means [` \log{A}<0 `].

[` B>1 `] means [` \log{B} >0 `].

Since [` AB<1 `], we know that [` \log{(AB)} <0 `], so [` \log{A}+\log{B}<0 `].

Since [` \log{B} >0 `], the sum [` \log{A}+\log{B} `] is greater than [` \log{A} `].

Since [` \log{(B^A)}=A \ \log{B} `], and since both [` A `] and [` \log{B} `] are positive, we know that [` \log{(B^A)}>0 `].

Since [` A<1 `], we know that the product [` A \ \log{B} `] is less than [` \log{B} `].

Putting this all together, we have
[`` \log{A} < \log{A}+\log{B} < 0 < \log{(B^A)} < \log{B} ``]
