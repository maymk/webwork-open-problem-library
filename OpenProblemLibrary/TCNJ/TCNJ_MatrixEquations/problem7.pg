An equation is consistent if and only if it has a solution.';

push @yesTF, DropDownTF("True");
push @yesSol, 'True.  If the matrix \(A\) had a pivot position in every row then one could solve the equation \(Ax=b\) using row reduction and back substitution, so the equation would be consistent, not inconsistent, because it would have a solution.';

push @yesTF,DropDownTF("True");

push @yesSol, 'True. If the columns of \(A\) do not span \(\mathbb{R}^m\) then there is a vector \(b\in \mathbb{R}^m\) that is not in the span of the columns, so the equation \(Ax=b\) has no solution, so it is inconsistent.';

Others might describe it as a "matrix equation" if they regard \(x\) as a \(1\times n\) matrix and \(b\) as a \(1\times m\) matrix.  It depends on your point of view.  This is an aspect of the power of linear algebra: the same expression can represent many different things. ';

$notEnoughData = 'False. The hypothesis "the augmented matrix has a pivot position in every row" does not provide enough information, by itself, to determine whether the equation is consistent or inconsistent. It could go either way. Therefore the given general statement is false. 

For example, the 
simple equation \(x_1=0\) has an obvious solution, so it is consistent. Its 
augmented matrix \([1\vert 0]\) has a pivot in every row.  (Yes, there
is only one row).  But the equally simple equation \(0x_1 = 1\) has no solution so it is inconsistent, but its augmented matrix \([0\vert 1]\) also has a pivot in every row. ';

BEGIN_PGML
In the following statements [`A`] represents an arbitrary [`m\times n`] matrix of real numbers, and [`x \in \mathbb{R}^n`] and [`b\in \mathbb{R}^m`] represent arbitrary vectors.  Mark each statement "True" or "False" by selecting the correct response on the left.  Remember that a general statement "if P then Q" is true if and only if Q is true in every case where P is true.
