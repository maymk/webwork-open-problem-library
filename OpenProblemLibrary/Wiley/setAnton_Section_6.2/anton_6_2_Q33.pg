BEGIN_PGML
Find the volume of the solid [`S`] generated when the region enclosed by the curves [`y = \sqrt{x+[$a]}`] , [`y=\sqrt{[$b]x}`] and [`y=0`] is revolved about the [`x`]-axis. (Hint: work the problem in two parts.)

    Volume of solid = [_]{$ans} cubic units

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
The curves [`y = \sqrt{x+[$a]}`] and [`y = \sqrt{[$b]x}`] intersect where

    [`` \begin{gathered} x+[$a] = [$b]x \\
    [$a]=[@ $b-1@] x \\
    [$x0] = x \\
    y=\sqrt{[$b]x} = \sqrt{[$y0sq]} 
    \end{gathered} ``]
    
The first curve [`y_1 = \sqrt{x+[$a]}`] is defined where [`x \geq -[$a]`].  The second curve [`y_2=\sqrt{[$b]x}`] is defined where [`x\geq 0`].  The figure shows the region enclosed by the two curves and the [`x`]-axis.

Let [`S_1`] be the solid obtained by revolving around the [`x`]-axis the region enclosed by the first curve [`y_1 = \sqrt{x+[$a]}`], the vertical line [`x=[$x0]`], and the [`x`]-axis.  

Let [`S_2`] be the solid obtained by revolving around the [`x`]-axis the region enclosed by the second curve [`y_2 = \sqrt{[$b]x}`], the vertical line [`x=[$x0]`], and the [`x`]-axis.  

The solid [`S`] is obtained by removing [`S_2`] from [`S_1`].  Therefore

    volume([`S`]) = volume([`S_1`]) - volume([`S_2`])

is the answer to this problem:  

    volume([`S_1`]) = [``\pi\int_{-[$a]}^{[$x0]} y_1^2\; dx = \pi\int_{-[$a]}^{[$x0]} x+[$a]\;dx = \left.\pi\Big(\frac{x^2}{2} + [$a]x\Big)\right|_{-[$a]}^{[$x0]} = [$VolS1coeff] \pi ``]

    volume([`S_2`]) = [``\pi\int_{0}^{[$x0]} y_1^2 \;dx = \pi\int_{0}^{[$x0]} [$b]x \;dx = \left.[$b]\pi \frac{x^2}{2}\right|_0^{[$x0]} = [$VolS2coeff] \pi ``]  

    volume([`S`]) = volume([`S_1`])-volume([`S_2`]) = [`[$VolCoeff]\pi`]  cubic units 
   
*Remark*  One can ignore the hint and solve this problem using the method of cylindrical shells.  Solving for [`x`] one has [`x=y^2-[$a]`] on the first curve and [`x=y^2/[$b]`] on the second curve as [`y`] runs from [`0`] to [`\sqrt{[$y0sq]}`] so the cylindrical shells method says 

    volume([`S`])=[``2\pi \int_0^{\sqrt{[$y0sq]}} \Big(\frac{y^2}{[$b]}-(y^2-[$a])\Big) y\; dy``]
    
Of course the answer is the same as before.
